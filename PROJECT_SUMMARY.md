# Scan Me Right - Project Summary

## 🎯 Project Overview

**Scan Me Right** is a privacy-first offline document scanner mobile application developed for the Mobile Devices Programming (PDM) course. The app solves a critical privacy concern: *"When I scan my docs with cloud services, who is actually getting my sensitive information?"*

### Core Value Proposition

   - All-caps header recognition
   - Basic text structure preservation

### 🚧 Phase 2: ML Model (Planned)

Future enhancements with custom TensorFlow Lite model:

1. **Training Data Generation** ✅
   - Python script for synthetic document generation
   - Augmentation pipeline (rotation, blur, lighting)
   - Labeled dataset with formatting annotations

2. **Model Training** (To Do)
   - MobileNetV3-based classifier
   - 5 classes: normal, bold, italic, underline, title
   - Transfer learning approach

3. **Deployment** (To Do)
   - Export to TensorFlow Lite
   - Integrate into Flutter app
   - Replace heuristics with ML predictions

### 🔮 Phase 3: Polish (Future)
